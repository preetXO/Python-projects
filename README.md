**Save the poor stickman, who was caught for using fake credit cards**
Well it's a game why don't you go ahead and try it yourself first. So what it does is it will ask you to guess some letters of a word and you will have 6 lives. if you guess a letter which is not in word you loose a life :( and the poor stickman would be one step closer to death. So test your vocabulary and i am sure you will win most of the times.
