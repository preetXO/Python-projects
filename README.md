List of all the python projects
The order is as follows: 
1) [Password Generator](https://replit.com/@preetpalsinghsp/password-generator-start#Password%20Generator.py)
This code generates random password based on the input given by user, the password is always gonna be a different combination of latters, numbers and symbols in a random order.
2) [Hangman](https://replit.com/@preetpalsinghsp/Hangman)
**Save the poor stickman, who was caught for using fake credit cards**

Well it's a game why don't you go ahead and try it yourself first. So what it does is it will ask you to guess some letters of a word and you will have 6 lives. if you guess a letter which is not in word you loose a life :( and the poor stickman would be one step closer to death. So test your vocabulary and i am sure you will win most of the times.
